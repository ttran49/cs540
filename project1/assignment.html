</head><body><h1>CS 440/540 Spring 2019</h1>
<h1>Assignment #1: Using Lex:  XML to C</h1>
<h1>Due:  See blackboard</h1>

The goal of this assignment is to use Lex (flex, jflex) as a source-to-source transformation tool to transform code 
written in a very simple XML programming language to C.   
<p>
NOTE - you will not be parsing the input language.   The output for your
 tool will not be checked on files that do not meet the specification
below.    You will be making lots of assumptions based on the fact that 
the input will be correct.  I've given you some starting code (C and
Java) to give you an idea what I mean.

</p><h2>Input</h2>

Our XML based programming language only has a few different 
instructions.  We could add more but this is sufficient for this 
exercise.
<ul> <li> function - we can define a function with zero or more parameters (all integers) with an integer return type.
</li><li> add - includes a "result" and one or more op(erands) which can
 be variables or constants.   Works like a copy insturction if only one 
op.  
</li><li> sub - similar to add
</li><li> return - includes a single op(erand) that can be a variable constant
</li><li> call - function call has an optional result and zero or more params
</li><li> if - standard if/then and if/then/else control flow.   The else clause is optional
</li></ul> 

An example program that includes all of the
different instructions is:
<pre>&lt;function name="mult" param="a" param="b"  &gt;
&lt;if condition="a&gt;0" &gt;
        &lt;sub result="x" op="a" op="1" /&gt;
        &lt;call result="y" name="mult"  param="x" param="b" /&gt;
        &lt;add result="x" op="b" op="y" /&gt;
        &lt;return op="x"/&gt;
        &lt;else/&gt;
        &lt;return op="0" /&gt;
&lt;/if&gt;
&lt;/function&gt;
</pre>

We are making the following simplifying assumptions
<ul>
<li> We are only dealing with ints.
</li><li> All variable names (except functions) are a single character 
and are declared globally (see start code) to simplify the problem.
</li><li> All attributes for an instruction will be in the order given above and spacing will be as shown.
</li></ul>

<h2>Transforming the Input</h2>

You will be transforming the given input into compilable C.  For example, the mult program above would have output like:
<pre><font color="red">int a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m;
int n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z; 

int mult(int a, int b) { </font>
   if (a&gt;0) {
      x = a - 1 ;
      y = mult(x,b);
      x = b + y ;
      return x;
   } else {
      return 0;
   }
<font color="red">}</font>

</pre>

Notice that I'm indenting 3 spaces inside a function and three for every
 if statement.   I will be checking your ouput by compiling it to be 
sure to check this
yourself.   I have starting code that transforms the &lt;function ... 
&gt; instruction already
and does the global declarations (the part shown in red above).

<h2>Notes</h2>
Your submitted solution must run on zeus.vse.gmu.edu for credit.  It 
must use standard tools (flex, gcc, java, etc) available on the system. 
Yes, I know they are not always the latest version; however, they will 
work fine for your assignments.
<br>
If you are working in C or C++, your tool will, by default, read input from <tt> stdin</tt> and write to <tt>stdout</tt>.  
To use an input file with your tool, use IO redirection:
<br><tt>a.out &lt; myfile</tt>
<p>
If you are working in Java, the default is to get a file name and read 
your input from that file.  To run your tool, I should have to type 
something like:<br>
<tt>java yourtool myfile</tt>

</p><h1> Submitting your assignment</h1>

<p>
Submit a zip or tar file with ALL of your code on Blackboard.  In the 
submission comment, tell me what language (C, C++, Java) you are using 
and if 
you do not include a Makefile, give me complete instructions in a ReadMe
 file for building your executable.   If the TA can't quickly build your
 assignment, 
there will be points deducted.
</p><p>
If submitting a tar file, CHECK (and double check) your file to be sure 
that you have included all needed elements.  If you accidently submit an
 empty file 
or miss some file, you will only be allowed to correct this problem if 
the files in your zeus directory have a timestamp <em>before</em> the due time.
